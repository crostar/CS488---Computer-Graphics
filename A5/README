## Compilation
The compiation steps is as follows:
```{bash}
$ cd A3
$ premake4 gmake
$ make
$ ./A3 Asset/puppet.lua
```
The dev program has been run on the local virtual machine

## Manual
The puppet created in this assignment is [Mr. Krabs](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Eugene_H._Krabs)
(A fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants.)

#### Important notes for grading
- Mr. Krabs does not have a rotatable "head" in the common sense. Thus, dragging the right
mouse in the JOINTS mode controls the rotation of his **eyes** around y-axis.
  - Click on the white part of the eyes to select the eye joint
  - Drag middle/right mouse to see the rotation

#### Data structure changes
- SceneNode
  - render is implemented inside SceneNode class family
  - JointNode
    - Accumulated rotation angles are stored, which is referred to calculate
    the rotation matrix upon rendering.

- OperationStack
  - Command pattern is implemented in JointNode.hpp, where new data structure
  Operation and OperationStack are defined

#### Hierarchical model
List of parts in the model:
- Torso
- Eyes - Eye lids - Eyebrow
- Nose
- Mouth
- Arms - Hands - Pliers
- Legs
- Belt and button

The hierarchical model is illustrated in the following chart. Note only right side
is described. The mouth, nose and legs are omited in the chart since the structure is trivial and
similar to the other parts.

- In the chart, yellow nodes are SceneNode, blue nodes are Joints and purple nodes
are GeometryNode.
